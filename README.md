# KennelIndexer

Front-end part of a simple CRUD app written in Angular that lets you add users to a database, viewing profiles and seeing all users in a search-able table on the front-page.

The application uses [Ant Design of Angular](https://ng.ant.design/docs/introduce/en) as a UI component library.

Note that this uses a .net web API as backend. The repository for that can be found [Here](https://github.com/thom9346/KennelIndexerAPIV2)
